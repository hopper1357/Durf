What is Warrior, Rogue & Mage?
WR&M is a simple, lightweight role playing game that allows a group of players and a game master (GM) to experience epic adventures in a fantasy world filled with conflict, monsters and
wondrous magic.

Although WR&M uses the three archetypal roles of classic role playing games in its title, it doesn’t make use of classes. Players can freely create characters as they see fit without having to press them into the tight corset of character classes. Warrior, Rogue and Mage are actually the characters’ basic attributes, which measure their capabilities in combat, stealth and academics respectively.

This book assumes you are familiar with tabletop RPGs. If you have no idea how a tabletop role
playing game is supposed to work, ask your geek friends; they’ll probably know.

Characters
Each player has to create a character in order to play. The player character is his or her representation in the game world. The characters played by the game master are called non-player characters orNPCs. All characters in WR&M are described by their three basic attributes, skills, talents and various other values, which will be explained in detail in this chapter.Each player has to create a character in order to play. The player character is his or her representation in the game world. The characters played by the game master are called non-player characters or NPCs. All characters in WR&M are described by their three basic attributes, skills, talents and various other values, which will be explained in detail in this chapter.

Attributes
WR&M uses three basic attributes to describe a character: Warrior, Rogue and Mage. Each attribute is usually ranked from 0 to 6, but monsters and veteran characters may have higher values. If an attribute is ranked at 0 you can't use any related skills. And in the case of the Mage attribute you can't cast even the simplest spell.

A character with a high rank in Warrior is the born fighter: strong, tough,fearless. Characters with a low rank in this attribute lack these abilities. Someone with a high Rogue attribute is witty, stealthy and quick with his feet and mind. A highly ranked Mage attribute is a sign of intelligence, strength of will and mental discipline.

Each player character starts with 10 attribute levels that may be freely distributed between the three attributes. No attribute may start higher than 6 though. While highly specialized characters are possible, a well-rounded character with a few levels in each attribute probably works best for new players.

Skills
Each character is also further detailed by a couple of skills. Skills are abilities a character has learned over the years like Riding or Thievery. Skills are not ranked like attributes though. You either have learned a skill, or you don't. Each character starts with three skills of the players choice. Please note that you can't choose a skill if the relevant attribute is ranked at level 0!

Talents
Talents give player characters special abilities that set them apart from mere commoners. You don't have to roll the dice in order to use talents. As soon as a character has acquired a new talent he gets access to a special ability. Some talents may be taken several times.

Hitpoints, Fate and Mana
Hitpoints are a measure of how many hits a character may sustain before going down. A character with 0 HP is considered dead or dying. Fate can be used to save one's life in certain situations, or take over some narrative control from the GM. Mana is the raw magical energy that is used by Mages to cast magic spells. Characters can't perform any magic when their Mana is depleted.

Each character starts with Hipoints equal to 6 plus his Warrior attribute, Fate equal to his Rogue attribute and Mana equal to two times his Mage attribute. You start with at least 1 Fate if your Rogue attribute is at level 0, though.

Armor and Defense
Each character has a Defense stat that is equal to 4 plus half the sum of his Warrior and Rogue attributes rounded down. Worn armor and shields grants a bonus to Defense but raise the Mana cost of spells by their Armor Penalty (AP).
Rules Mechanics

Basic Task Resolution
Every time a character wants to perform an action which has a chance of failing, the GM may ask the player to roll the dice to determine the outcome of said action. The basic task resolution method is the attribute check. The GM picks the appropriate attribute and decides how difficult the task at hand is. Then the player rolls one six-sided die (also called d6) and adds the relevant attribute's level to the roll's result. If the character knows any skills that might help in that situation, he may add 2 to his result. The final result is then compared to the difficulty level set by the GM. If the result is equal or higher the task was successful. If not, the task failed.

Optional: If a character knows more than one skill that could be used in a given situation, the GM may allow the player to add another 2 to the result.

Exploding die
Whenever a player rolls a 6, the die may "explode". This means, the player may roll again and add the second result. If the second result is another 6, you roll again. Only damage rolls and attribute checks where the character owns an appropriate skill are subject to this rule.

Automatic success
When the risk of failing is extremely low, or the task is only of minor importance to the story, and the character has the appropriate skill, the GM may decide that no roll is necessary.

Unopposed check
If the task at hand is not actively opposed, the player has to beat a difficulty level determined by the GM.

Difficulty (DL)
Easy (5)
Routine (7)
Challenging (9)
Hard (11)
Extreme (13)

Opposed check
When two characters are in direct competition, the opposed check method is used. The DL of the active character is determined by a roll made by the passive character. 

Example: A thief wants to sneak past a guard unnoticed. The guard then rolls a d6 and adds his Mage attribute and the +2 bonus if he owns the Awareness skill to the result. This result then is the DL for the thief's attribute check.

Optional: Instead of rolling, you can just add 3 to the relevant attribute (and the skill bonus) to get the DL.
Circumstantial modifiers
There are circumstances which can make tasks harder or easier to perform than usual: The lack of tools makes it harder to craft something, a master crafted weapon grants a bonus to an attack, or bad lighting conditions make it easier to hide in the shadows. The GM may add circumstantial modifiers to any DL if appropriate.

Using Fate
A character can spend one of his Fate points to do the following (GM approval needed): 

    • Ignore an attack that would have killed the character
    • Change a minor detail in the game world. For example: your character knows the NPC you’ve just met. Or there is a shop in the town you just entered with the equipment you need.
    • Reroll a single die roll or add +2 to a single check

Fate doesn't regenerate automatically, so players are advised not to waste their Fate. GMs are meant to grant players Fate for heroic actions, good role playing and certain goals their characters achieved.

Combat

Initiative
Whenever combat occurs, player characters and non-player characters act in turns. At the start of combat, the sequence in which the two sides in the conflict act is determined. This is called initiative. In most cases common sense dictates the initiative. If unsure roll a die for each side. The side with the higher result acts first.

Optional: A character with the Awareness skill may add +2 to the initiative roll.


Combat actions
Combat turns are pretty short, so characters can only perform a few actions. Running a short distance, drawing a weapon, attacking a foe, casting a spell are reasonable actions that can be performed during one turn.

Attack roll
When a character tries to hit another character in close or ranged combat, his player has to roll the dice to determine if he has hit. Attack rolls work like any other attribute check but the DL is always the target's Defense stat plus any applicable modifiers. Attack rolls are subject to the "exploding die" rule if the character has the appropriate skill and that each additional success after the first adds +1 to the damage caused. Please refer to the Magic chapter for magic attacks.

Example: A thief wants to backstab a guard with a dagger. The skill list determines that when using a dagger the Rogue attribute applies. The thief knows this skill, so he may also add the +2 modifier to his attack roll.

Damage and Healing
After having scored a hit, you determine the damage caused. Damage is determined by the weapon used. See the weapon list for details. Please note that damage rolls are always subject to the "exploding die" rule. The victims hitpoints are reduced by a number of points equal to the damage caused. If the hitpoints drop to 0, the character is dead or dying. A character's HP may never drop below 0.

Optional: Characters who were reduced to under half their maximum hitpoints are considered seriously wounded and get a -3 modifier on all checks.

A character heals hitpoints equal to his highest attribute per day of rest. Only light activities are allowed during that time. If a character takes part in a combat, chase or a similar activity he may only heal a single hitpoint that day. Characters with the Herbalism skill may use his abilities to speed up healing. When treated by such a character, you get +2 HPs per day of rest.

Magic

Using Magic
Characters with a Mage attribute of 1 or higher have access to spells. Spells can be found or bought. These spells must first be transferred to a character's personal spell book before they can be used. To cast a spell from the book, the character has to make a roll versus the DL or the spell. If successful, his mana pool is reduced by the amount listed for the spell.

Magic implement
A character who wants to focus on magic usually owns a magic implement. This may be a staff, gauntlet, ring, or a similar piece of equipment. Magic implements are used to store spells that the magic user can later cast without having to spend any mana from his personal pool. Magic implements have to be charged with mana before they can be used and that mana pool is then used to power spell cast from it. As long as it is powered it also grants a thaumaturgy bonus equal to its level. An implement can hold 10 mana per level of the item. Powering the implement is expensive though. For each mana stored in the implement, the caster has to spend two from his personal pool. Implements may be charged in multiple sessions.

A character can only store spells he knows in a magic implement. The stored spell remains in the implement until replaced. A magic implement can store spells up to its level. A level 3 implement may store one 3rd circle spell, but it may also be used to store one 2nd circle and one 1st circle spell or three 1st circle spells.

Mana regeneration
A character gets back his full mana pool for a good night's sleep and receives mana equal to his Mage attribute for one hour of meditation. Magic potions may also regenerate mana.

Casting Spells
In order to cast spells a character needs at least Mage level 1. The thaumaturgy skill is helpful, but not necessary, especially if the character wants to use only a few simple spells. The range of all spells is the line of sight if the spell description does not say otherwise.
Spells are divided into four circles. Spells of the 1st circle are the easiest and less powerful, while 4th circle spell are considerably more powerful and need more skill to be cast.

Circle         Mana cost         DL
 1st               1                  5 
 2nd               2                  7
 3rd               4                  9
 4th               8                  13


A caster that wears armor needs to add the AP of the armor worn to the mana cost.

Mana burning
A spell caster may choose to burn additional mana to improve the spell's effects. Each level of mana burn costs half the initial mana cost and raises the spells DL by one. The effects of the mana burn are listed with each spells description. Please note that you have to use mana from your personal pool for mana burning even if you cast a spell from an implement.

Sustaining spells
Usually all spells have a certain duration or cause an instant effect. But there may be cases when a caster wants to sustain a spell over longer periods of time. If a spell can be sustained, it's listed in the spells description. In order to sustain a spell over longer period of time, the caster has to concentrate which penalizes all of his actions by a modifier of -1. The mana cost for sustaining the spell is listed with the spell's description. 

Variant: Warrior, Rogue, & Scholar
Magic is very common in WR&M. Everyone with a Mage attribute value of 1 or higher can cast spells. If you want to run a more low-magic 
game, you can make the following changes:

The Mage attribute is replaced by the Scholar attribute. All skills that used Mage before now use the Scholar attribute. This is a purely cos-
metic change, so if this isn’t that important to you, you can of course stick to the Mage attribute.

In order to cast spells a character needs to buy a new talent called “Spellcaster” which gives access to 1st circle spells. Spell casting works as usual, although you are restricted to basic spells when you start with a new character. All other talents that affect your magic abilities (like Blood Mage) need Spellcaster as a prerequisite now. When the character levels up, he can acquire “Advanced Spellcaster” which grants him access to the remaining spell circles.

This optional rule allows low-magic campaigns. By disallowing the Spellcaster talent you can even play without any magic at all.

Magic Items

Runeblade
This rune covered sword ignores any armor. Attack rolls with this weapon are made against basic Defense.

Holy Sword
This gold-hilted, silvery blade is bane against the undead, inflicting 2d6 damage to skeletons, zombies, vampires, and their ilk.

Warmage armor
This plate armor from the time of the Imperium uses special enchantments to allow casters to wear it without penalty. It’s statistics are equal to normal plate armor, but it’s AP is 0.

Enchanted armor
The most common of enchanted armors, these suits and shields are unusually durable and permit the flow of arcane energies more effectively. Enchanted armors and shields gain a +1 Defense bonus and reduce their Armor Penalties by 1. Roll 1d6 to determine the type, then another 1d6 to determine the actual armor/shield:
Roll 1. Type (1-4: Armor, 5-6: Shield)
Roll 2. Actual armor/shield (Armor 1: Leather, 2: Scale, 3: Lamellar, 4: Chain, 5: Light Plate, 6: Heavy Plate; Shield 1-2: Small Shield, 3-5: Large Shield, 6: Tower Shield)

Healing potion
This vial contains a red bubbling liquid that heals 1d6 HP when quaffed.

Mana potion
This vial contains a blue bubbling potion that restores 1d6 Mana points when quaffed.

Gauntlets of Titanic Strength
These large gauntlets cause 2d6 damage when used for unarmed attacks.

Feathered cloak
This cloak is completely covered by raven feathers that slow every fall, so that the wearer does not sustain any damage from the fall.

Changestave
This simple whitewood stave can extend or retract on command, shrinking so as to fit within the palm or growing up to 10 yards in length or any length in between. This makes it extremely versatile; it can be easily concealed, used as a baton or staff in combat, used as a walking stick, used for poling rafts and boats over shallow water, or for bridging gaps shorter than its full extended length. The Changestave has the same traits as the staff when used in combat.

Game Mastering

The following section is for the Gamemaster only. If you are a player, please stop reading here.

Running Warrior, Rogue & Mage
WR&M leaves a lot of room for interpretation in the rules. Not everything you can think of has been covered by the rules and in many cases GM fiat plays a major role. It shares this with a lot of early roleplaying games, which are now called "old school". But that aspect of the game allows it to be a perfect toolbox for players and GMs alike. If there's something missing from the game, you need for your campaign, just add it. If there's something that bothers you, change it or drop it completely. The possibilities are endless and the rules-lite nature of the game allows you to make the game your own without having to fear you break the whole game.

Start slow but then go epic
Especially if you haven't run WR&M before, you should start things slow. Don't throw your players into an epic adventure at once but try to get a feel for the rules and the lethality of combat first. There's nothing more frustrating for your gamers than to have to face a total party kill in the first session.
But after you're more comfortable with the game you should turn things up a notch. WR&M is supposed to be epic fantasy. The setting included in the book hints at powerful artifacts, lost technologies and ruined cities. This is probably what the players expect when they sit down at the gaming table, so the GM should deliver.

GM rulings instead of rules
In most cases it's much faster and better for the flow of the game if the GM makes rulings when there's a rule discussion. Nothing destroys the mood of any game more than a lengthy discussion about some rules and the interpretation of what is printed in the book. To avoid that, the GM always has the last word in these cases. If the issue at hand still bothers you after the game, just look it up and make up your mind. But during the game you should just decide something instead of making a fuss about it.

Make it your own
I can't stress this enough: make WR&M your own. GMs and players are encouraged to bring their own ideas to the table. Add new lands, create new monster, change the rules, write up your own spells. Whatever suits your fancy, do it. A lot of creativity went into the production of the game, but it definitely shouldn't end there! This book contains several optional rules that you can use, but you can of course add your own house rules as well. And if you think there's something critical or just very cool missing from the game, let us know!

Setting the mood with music
When it comes to setting the mood nothing is better than playing some epic music in the background. Some people prefer movie and computer game soundtracks, some people prefer heavy metal tunes. The important part is that you and your players are comfortable with the music and that it enhances the mood of the game. Playing music from a horror movie in the background is a great way to improve the immersion if you're running a horror adventure.


Character advancement
Characters in WR&M don’t have levels or need to amass experience points to improve their abilities. The GM decides when he thinks the characters are ready to advance. Usually this happens at the end of a successful adventure. If you want to let the characters advance faster, the you can allow them to advance after each session. Whenever the GM allows the players to advance they may do the following:

    • Raise one attribute by one.
    • Add 1d6 to either HP or Mana
    • Gain an additional skill
    • Gain a talent 1

1 Talents should be harder to get than an additional skill or HPs. The GM should send the player character on a sidequest to find a trainer, get admission to a special group or learn an ancient ritual that unlocks that talent.

Optional: The GM can allow players to add 3 points of HP or Mana when they level up instead of rolling the dice.

Non-combat hazards
Aside from combat there are a lot of ways a character may be harmed. The table below lists a few possible hazards.

Hazard		Damage
Fall                   	1d6 per 3 yards of fall
Suffocation/drowning	1d6 per round
Mild poison		1d3 initial damage, 1 dam./rnd. until successful Warrior check vs. DL 7.
Lethal poison		1d6 initial damage, 2 dam./rnd. until successful Warrior check vs. DL 11.
Fire			1d6 per round exposed to the flames

Appendix 2: Optional Rules

Non-human player characters
A common trope of the fantasy RPG genre are non-human player character, mainly Elves, Dwarves, Halflings and Gnomes. Some games even allow players to play a member of the more bestial races, like Orcs, Goblins or even more fantastic creatures. Although there are no Elves, Dwarves, Gnomes and Halflings in the campaign setting presented here in the book, they may be viable player options in other fantasy settings.

Player races
At the beginning of character creation the player chooses the race of his character. He can choose from the following list, or the GM may create more races if he wishes.

Elf
Elves are usually looking like slender, beautiful humans with slightly elongated limbs and pointed ears. Elves have less body hair than humans. Elves have an exceptional talent for magic. Elves live much longer than humans but mature about as fast.
Racial talents: Exceptional Attribute (Mage), Sixth Sense*, Weak

Dwarf
Dwarves are shorter and stockier than humans. Male dwarves usually sport thick and long beards. Dwarves are very strong and tough for their small size and are known for their fighting prowess. Dwarves live longer than humans but not as long as the Elves.
Racial talents: Exceptional Attribute (Warrior), Craftsman* (craft of player's choice), No Talent for Magic

Halflings
Halflings are even shorter than Dwarves and are sometimes even mistaken for human children. They usually live peaceful lives far away from the bustling towns of the humans. But if one of the members of that race goes on adventuring their exceptional talent for thievery shows.
Racial talents: Exceptional Attribute (Rogue), Hunter*, Weak

Lizardmen
Lizardmen are an intelligent species that evolved from lizards. Instead of their ancestors they are not cold-blooded anymore, but they still prefer hot and dry areas. They resemble a humanoid lizard with scales instead of skin which also doubles as armor. Lizardmen are known for there lack of strong emotions and their keen logic.
Racial talents: Natural Armor (Defense 2), Tough as Nails*, Outcast

Goblins
Goblins are the smallest of the greenskin races. They have a green skin, very long pointed ears and are about 1 yard tall. They have high voices and a mouth of razor-sharp teeth. Goblins seem to have a knack for salvaging and tinkering.
Racial talents: Tinkerer, Lucky Devil*, Weak

Orcs
Orcs are slightly larger than humans, green skinned and are exceptionally strong. They can be savage warriors but they have a strong sense of honor. They usually look down on the smaller races like Goblins and Halflings. Orcish adventurers are a rare sight to behold, but often they are accompanied by one of their tame black wolves.
Racial talents: Berserker, Exceptional Attribute (Warrior), Outcast

*) See Appendix 1 for details

Racial talents
A member of a non-human race gets a number of racial talents which help him to set apart from ordinary humans. Some of these talents are actually drawbacks meant to balance out the advantages that certain races get. GMs are encouraged to invent their own racial talents. The talents given in this chapter are meant as a source for inspiration. With the GMs approval players of other races may pick some of these talents as well.

Berserker
This talent allows a character to go berserk during combat. This adds +2 to the Warrior attribute and all the damage caused. Temporarily the berserker ignores all damage effects. You still have to note down all the damage taken though, since the damage takes effect as soon as the berserk wears off. The Mage attribute is reduced to 0 during the duration of that effect and casting of magic is impossible. The character has to attack his nearest enemy only and is only allowed to fight in close quarters. When all the enemies are on the ground the berserker has to make an unmodified Easy (5) Mage check. If the check is successful, the effect ends and the character drop unconscious to the ground. If he has taken enough damage to be reduced to 0 or less HP he's dead or dying. If his HPs are still 1 or more, he's knocked out for 2d6 minutes before he awakes with a headache.
In the case the roll was unsuccessful he has to attack the nearest ally. 

Exceptional Attribute
This talent allows the player to roll two six-sided dice instead of one when making a check using the relevant attribute. The highest result counts.

Natural Armor
Natural armor usually is in the form of scales or thick fur that protects the character from damage. The Defense granted by natural armor works as long as no other armor is worn.

No Talent for Magic
A character with this talent has a hard time grasping the concepts of magic or has a natural resistance to channeling mana. When making a casting check, the character rolls two d6 and takes the lowest result. In addition to that mana costs are doubled.

Tinkerer
A character with that talent has a knack for all things technical. He gets a +2 bonus on all checks related to repairing, dismantling or using technical equipment like mechanical traps, firearms, war golems, clockwork etc.

Weak
A character with this talent is more frail than the common man. He starts play with 3 + the Warrior Attribute and when levelling up he only gets 1d6-2 hitpoints (minimum is 1 hp though).

Outcast
A character with this racial talent is considered an outcast in most societies. Every test related to social interaction with a member of a different race is modified by 3.

Dual-wielding and multiple attacks
The talent Dual-wielding already allows characters to wield two weapons at once, although it does not grant additional attacks. If the GM approves player may also attack with both weapons in one round if they take the talent Double Attack with has Dual-wield as a prerequisite. When using Double Attack the character gets an additional attack with his off-hand weapon. Please note that both weapons have to be of the same type in order to use this maneuver. Two melee weapons or two ranged weapons are fine (dragon pistols for example), but one ranged and one melee weapon can't be used in that way. Please note that you can't dual-wield two-handed weapons.

Mounted Combat and Vehicle Combat
Mounted combat and vehicle combat are basically handled much like combat between characters. The main difference are Maneuver checks. Fighting from horseback or out of a fast-moving vehicle like horse-drawn carriage can be a complicated and dangerous matter.

Maneuvers
Whenever a character wants to perform a maneuver on a horse or on a moving vehicle he has to make a Maneuver check. When he's riding a horse (or similar) mount he makes a riding check with a DL decided by the GM everytime he wants to perform a maneuver. Just moving in a straight line is not considered a maneuver in itself as long as the rider/driver is not fighting. Here are some example for common DLs:

Maneuver		DL
Walk (Horse) 		-
Canter (Horse)	5
Gallop (Horse)	9
Tight Turn 		7
Sudden Stop 		9
Jump over obstacle 	7

When the maneuver check is successful the character can perfom combat actions like attacks, reloading his weapon or something similar. But if the check fails the character may fall from the horse or crash. In case the maneuver performed was riding/driving in a straight line, the character has to reduce speed immediately.

Ritual Magic
Especially spells of the higher circles are beyond the reach of most casters. For one the DLs are pretty high and the mana cost itself may pose a problem for beginner mages. But with GMs approval casters may choose to perform ritual magic.
The main difference between ritual magic and normal spell magic is that it takes a long time to perform. The following list gives the minimum casting times for ritual magic. Of course it doesn't usually make sense to use ritual magic for combat spells like Firebolt. The mana cost of the spell stays the same, and spell enhancement can be used, but the casting difficulty is reduced by 1 when the ritual is performed in the minimum time. If you take the double time, the DL is reduced by 2, and so on.


Circle		Time	Max. Participants
1st circle 	1 min 	3
2nd circle 	5 min 	6
3rd circle 	15 min	9
4th circle 	1 hour	12

When more than one person performs the ritual they can pool their mana. If one or more participants have the Blood Mage talent they can use it to convert any participants HPs to Mana, too. This is often used in the form of ritual sacrifices where a Blood Mage performs a ritual and kills one of the (often involuntarily) participants to release his mana into the spell. The mana gained in such a way is doubled.
